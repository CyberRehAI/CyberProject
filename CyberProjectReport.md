Keylogger Project for CyberSecurity:





1. Introduction
This report documents a controlled cybersecurity experiment designed to demonstrate the exploitation of human error and inadequate security measures. The experiment centered on deploying a custom-built keylogger disguised as a calculator application on a Windows 10 (version 1507) system. Through this analysis, we examine the vulnerabilities exploited, attack methodology, and essential risk mitigation strategies.






2. Objectives
The experiment focused on three primary objectives:
Demonstrating human error exploitation in a controlled environment
Analyzing deployment and activation methods of malicious software
Developing comprehensive recommendations for attack prevention
3. Vulnerability Analysis
Introduction
As organizations increasingly rely on digital communication, the risk of cyberattacks has escalated. Email remains a primary vector for cybercriminals, who exploit human psychology to trick users into executing malicious files or divulging sensitive information. This report examines several vulnerabilities that can arise from email-based social engineering, including the execution of unsigned software, lack of endpoint protection, and the consequences of excessive user privileges.
Vulnerabilities Involved
1. Email-Based Social Engineering
Vulnerability: Execution of Malicious Files Delivered via Email
Email-based social engineering attacks often involve the delivery of malicious files disguised as legitimate attachments. Users may inadvertently execute these files, leading to severe security breaches.
Root Cause: Lack of Proper Email Filtering, Awareness, or Endpoint Protection
The primary reasons for this vulnerability include inadequate email filtering mechanisms, insufficient user awareness regarding phishing tactics, and ineffective endpoint protection solutions. Many organizations fail to implement robust email security measures, leaving users vulnerable to attacks.
Fixes:
Implement Robust Email Security Solutions: Organizations should deploy advanced email security solutions that include spam filters, attachment scanning, and URL filtering to detect and block malicious content.
User Education: Regular training sessions should be conducted to educate users on recognizing phishing attempts and malicious emails. Simulated phishing exercises can help reinforce this training.
2. Execution of Unsigned or Untrusted Software
Vulnerability: Execution of Untrusted or Unsigned Software
Once a malicious file is executed, it may install additional malware, such as keyloggers, that can compromise sensitive information.
Root Cause: Insufficient Application Control Policies
Many organizations lack stringent application control policies, allowing users to execute untrusted or unsigned software without proper checks.
Fixes:
Enable Application Control: Implement application control solutions, such as Microsoft AppLocker, to restrict the execution of unauthorized applications. This ensures that only pre-approved software can run on the system.
Software Integrity Verification: Ensure that all software is digitally signed and verify its integrity before execution. This can prevent the execution of tampered or malicious applications.
3. Lack of Endpoint Protection
Vulnerability: Failure to Detect or Block Keyloggers
In many cases, endpoint protection solutions fail to detect or block keyloggers upon execution, allowing them to operate undetected.
Root Cause: Ineffective or Outdated Antivirus/Antimalware Solutions
Organizations often rely on outdated antivirus solutions that may not recognize new or sophisticated threats.
Fixes:
Install and Update Robust Antivirus Software: Organizations should deploy comprehensive antivirus solutions that are regularly updated to recognize the latest threats.
Real-Time Threat Detection: Utilize real-time threat detection and behavior-based analysis to identify and block suspicious activities on endpoints.
4. Outbound Communication to Command and Control (C2) Server
Vulnerability: Successful Communication with Remote Servers
Once a keylogger is installed, it may communicate with a remote server to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as keystrokes.
Root Cause: Lack of Outbound Network Traffic Monitoring
Many organizations do not monitor outbound network traffic effectively, allowing malicious software to communicate with external servers undetected.
Fixes:
Configure Firewalls: Implement firewall rules to block unauthorized outbound connections. This can prevent malware from communicating with C2 servers.
Use DNS Filtering and IDS/IPS: Deploy DNS filtering and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor unusual traffic patterns and block malicious communications.
5. User Account Privileges
Vulnerability: Excessive Privileges Granted to User Accounts
Keyloggers often execute with sufficient privileges to log keystrokes and communicate externally, exacerbating the impact of the attack.
Root Cause: Lack of Privilege Separation
Many organizations do not enforce the principle of least privilege, allowing users to operate with excessive permissions.
Fixes:
Enforce Least Privilege Principles: Implement policies that restrict user privileges to only what is necessary for their roles. This minimizes the potential impact of a compromised account.
Use Standard User Accounts: Encourage users to operate with standard user accounts for day-to-day activities, reserving administrative accounts for specific tasks.
6. Outdated Operating System (Windows 1507)
Vulnerability: Running Unsupported OS Versions
Running an outdated operating system, such as Windows 1507, exposes systems to unpatched vulnerabilities and security risks.
Root Cause: Lack of Ongoing Support or Patch Management
4. Methodology
4.1 Malicious File Development
The team developed a Python-based keylogger with the following capabilities:
Keystroke recording utilizing the pyinput library
Functional calculator interface serving as camouflage
Azure-hosted remote server communication
Executable conversion through pyinstaller
4.2 Payload Delivery
The attack vector followed a straightforward path:
1.Initial file upload to OneDrive
2.Distribution via Outlook email attachment
3.Local machine download by the target
4.3 Payload Execution
Upon execution, the application presented a fully functional calculator interface while simultaneously activating the keylogger component. The malware maintained persistent keystroke logging and server communication, continuing operation even after application closure.
5. Tools and Technical Implementation
5.1 Technical Stack
The experiment utilized the following tools:
Python for core development
PyInstaller for executable creation
Azure Virtual Machine for C2 server hosting
5.2 Core Functionality
The application integrated three primary components:
Keystroke capture through pynput
Server communication via the requests library
Calculator interface implementation using tkinter
6. Key Observations
The experiment revealed several critical findings:
The payload successfully exploited user trust through effective disguise
Windows SmartScreen (version 1507) failed to detect the threat
The keylogger maintained undetected server communication
Real-time keystroke transmission persisted beyond application termination
7. Mitigation Strategies
7.1 User-Level Protection
Individual users should implement basic security practices:
Strict avoidance of untrusted executable files
Thorough file authentication before execution
7.2 Organizational Security
Organizations should establish comprehensive security measures:
Implementation of email attachment scanning
Group Policy restrictions on unverified executables
Regular user security awareness training
7.3 Administrative Controls
System administrators should deploy multiple layers of protection:
Regular Windows security updates
Comprehensive network traffic monitoring
Strict firewall configuration
DNS filtering and IDS/IPS implementation
EDR solution deployment
8. Conclusion
This experiment effectively demonstrates the critical intersection of user awareness and security measures in cybersecurity defense. The successful exploitation of user trust, combined with outdated security features and inadequate traffic monitoring, enabled the attack’s success in our controlled environment. Organizations can significantly enhance their security posture by implementing the recommended mitigation strategies.
